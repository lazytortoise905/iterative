            <p>How can we use the iterative design process to develop an interactive interface for an emerging startup?
                Explore our journey as we go through the entire process of mocking up a solution to a startup's
                concept, including sketches, prototypes, and user testing.</p>

            <h2 class="title">THE STARTUP</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="description" id="start">
            <p>We chose the startup <strong>LifeAt</strong>, which aims to serve as a "virtual getaway while you work". LifeAt's goal is to make doing work just a bit more relaxing and fun by 
                providing users with relaxing video backgrounds like a scenic beach, lush forest, or bustling cafe to look at while they work. More information about LifeAt can be found on their <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/lifeat" target="_blank">Y Combinator page</a>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                LifeAt's concept allows for a very broad user base: essentially any person who has a screen open while they work. However, we believe that
                the concept would be most popular with individuals who work with larger screens or multiple screens, as they could have an entire screen devoted to LifeAt, and thus be
                more easily immersed in their chosen video and audio. Based on this assumption, as well as the fact that the entire concept relies on having a large enough screen
                to be able to easily see a selected background, we decided to design a desktop interface.

                        <li>We replaced the home button with a larger and more obvious "back to scene" button, that takes users back to their selected video. </li>
                        <li>Our landing page seemed to only distract users from the primary functionality of the site, 
                            which is audio and video selection. We fixed this by removing the landing page, and having the log in page link directly to the audio/video selection page. </li>
                        <li>We implemented a new dropdown menu which drastically simplifies navigation and learnability.</li>

                        <li>We increased the opacity of elements of the calendar, making it significantly more readable.</li>
                        <li>We designated specific pages to be "scene" pages to solve the contrast issues created by a variable, colorful background</li>

                        <li>We prototyped minimization options in all scenarios to reduce user confusion</li>
                        <li>We removed the calendar feature from the minimized version of the "break with friends" page, as it was too difficult to interact with.</li>
                        <li>By completely redesigning our audio/video selection pages, we eliminated the confusion regarding white/blank space and made it clear that the "background" is in fact a key feature.</li>
                        <li>We concluded that the point of the app was to allow users to relax. A focus timer made no sense in this context, so we chose to remove it.</li>

                <strong>User 1:</strong> <br>This reviewer pointed out that we may have over shot it when we were attempting to solve our contrast issues. She pointed out issues with how "black" our application appears
                and in hindsight this critique absolutely has some merit. Instead of reducing all of the color in the background entirely we could likely have found a way to dilute it
                and still keep the app vibrant while maintaining a reasonable level of contrast.

                Additionally, she noted that originally she wanted to try and schedule a meeting with friends in her profile. This points to the idea that our hamburger menu may not have
                been as intuitive as it could have been, and the welcome Bill! message in the top right may just decrease learnability more than anything else.

                Finally, it would have been beneficial to add functionality that allowed users to simply click on the image instead of the maximize icon in the top right. This proved to be
                unintuitive and confusing.

            <strong>User 2:</strong> <br>This reviewer gave overall very positive feedback but was initially confused by our calendar functionality. Specifically, we offer a calendar that shows when your friends may be available to take a break throughout the workday. She initially thought that the availablity slots were already-scheduled breaks, rather than blocks where your friends may be available. She eventually figured out the actual functionality, but in the future we would like to make this less confusing.

                Additionally, this reviewer had a slight misinterpretation of the background scene. She interpreted the background scene as social -- that users pick a background to watch with friends, rather than play as background video/audio for work. We did not intend this, though this could be a useful feature to add. 
            </p>

                <strong>User 3:</strong> <br> This reviewer gave very positive feedback. They noted that the site was clear and easy to use, and that it would allow them to relax while working.

                One thing that we noticed is that although the reviewer noted that they found it easy to complete the second subtask (schedule a break with a friend), it seemed to take them a while to discover that they needed to use the dropdown
                menu to find the "break with friends" page. We could have made this easier by revising our navigation options to make page-to-page navigation a little more obvious.
